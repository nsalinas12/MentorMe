# Final Project - *Meta*

**Meta** tackles this problem:

Professional development is expensive and inaccessible to a large extent. There is a barrier to the mentor-mentee relationship.

*Application of Meta*

The user of Meta will be able to search for people that have skills they want and create appointments with them, as well as allow someone with experience to find mentees to support through their career.


Time spent: **240** hours spent in total

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How hard would it be to enable push notifications?
2. How do we conserve the use of data on our app to make it run faster?

## Notes

We did not expect to be making table view cells from just code, so that was definitely a set-back. We also made the mistake of initializing the cells in the wrong place, so at one point our app was taking forever to load and we could not figure out why. Managing our work with version control was a pretty new experience for all of us as well so when our first conflict happened and we lost some important code, we made a new repository which in hindsight was the wrong course of action. We
